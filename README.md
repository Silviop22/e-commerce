# E-COMMERCE SAMPLE APP
In this repo you will find a sample e-commerce application built using Spring Boot and AWS. The application is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices architecture in a real-world scenario.
## Microservices Breakdown:
- Product Service - Manages product catalog and inventory
- Order Service - Handles order processing and management
- Payment Service - Processes payments and refunds
- User Service - Manages user accounts and authentication
- Notification Service - Sends emails, SMS, and push notifications
- Review Service - Handles product reviews and ratings

## Why This Justifies Microservices:

- Independent Scaling: During sales events, your Order and Product services might need more resources than others
- Technology Flexibility: Payment service might use stronger security libraries
- Resilience: If the Review service fails, the core shopping experience continues
- Team Organization: Different teams can own different services
- Deployment Independence: Update the Notification service without redeploying everything

## Technical Implementation with Spring Boot & AWS:

- Each service as a separate Spring Boot application
- AWS ECS or EKS for container orchestration
- API Gateway for routing
- Shared authentication with AWS Cognito or a custom solution
- DynamoDB or RDS for persistence
- Service discovery with AWS Cloud Map or Spring Cloud

## JMS Integration Point:
The Order Service would be an excellent place to demonstrate JMS integration. When an order is placed:

- Order Service publishes a message to an order-created topic
- Payment Service subscribes and processes payment
- Inventory Service subscribes and updates stock
- Notification Service subscribes and sends confirmation emails

This asynchronous communication pattern shows how microservices can work together without tight coupling.
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this example, or should we discuss implementation details for the demo?
